# XNA_RacingGame

Player can select from two cars to drive. First car is faster and has a higher top speed, and the second car is a slower with lower top speed. The goal of the player is to get the highest score possible. The player has 5 lives and loses one each time the car crashes into obstacles. There will be two items randomly generated that the user can collect. The first item is a gold coin that gives points, and the second item is nitrous oxide which gives more points but increases the speed of the car and makes it harder to dodge obstacles. Game setting is located on a road in the desert with various obstacles on it.
